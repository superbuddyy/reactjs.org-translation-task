# Maintainer Guide

This document lists the responsibilities and resources available to maintainers of reactjs.org translation forks.

## Maintainer Responsibilities

As repo maintainers and members of the React community, your responsibilities are as follows:

### Push the translation through

### Be prompt

As with maintaining any repository, be prompt with reviewing pull requests / responding to volunteers.


### Keep the repo up to date

Maintainers should promptly review the issues generated by [reactjs-translation-bot](https://github.com/reactjs-translation-bot) in order to make sure translations remain up to date with the source repo.

## Tips

### Make a glossary and style guide

Create a *glossary* of the translations of technical and React-specific terms. Put this in a highly visible location (the README or a pinned issue). For examples of glossaries, see:

* Simplified Chinese: https://github.com/reactjs/zh-hans.reactjs.org/issues/2
* Japanese: https://github.com/reactjs/ja.reactjs.org/wiki/%E8%A8%B3%E8%AA%9E%E3%81%AE%E7%B5%B1%E4%B8%80
* Spanish: https://github.com/reactjs/es.reactjs.org/blob/master/TRANSLATION.md#common-translations

Also, create a *style guide* to define additional rules to follow in translation. See the [universal style guide](/style-guide.md) for rules that should apply to *all* translations.

### Setup a review process

### Implement integration tools

### Ask for help

If you have a question that isn't addressed here, go to the global [ReactJS localization team](https://github.com/orgs/reactjs/teams/reactjs-org-localization) and ask your fellow translators for help! (NOTE: The link is only available to repo maintainers).
