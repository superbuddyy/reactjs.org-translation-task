## For New Translators

To translate a page:

1. Check that no one else has claimed your page in the checklist and comments below.
2. Comment below with the name of the page you would like to translate. **Please take only one page at a time**.
3. Clone this repo, translate your page, and submit a pull request!

Before contributing, read the glossary and style guide (once they exist) to understand how to translate various technical and React-specific terms.

Please be prompt with your translations! If you find that you can't commit anymore, let the maintainers know so they can assign the page to someone else.

## For Maintainers

When someone volunteers, edit this issue with the username of the volunteer, and with the PR. Ex:

* [ ] Home Page (@tesseralis) #1

When PRs are merged, make sure to mark that page as completed!
